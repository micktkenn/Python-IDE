# Python-IDE

To execute a code an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) is needed. IDE is an environment where we can write any program or code to execute it and display itâ€™s output. Using this python script anyone can create an IDE using a built-in python library called tkinter and subprocess.

This IDE contains two scrolledtext widgets. Top scrolledtext is used to write the code and save it which can be executed to display its output in bottom scrolledtext widget.

It has 5 menus - File, Edit, Run, Theme. 

Modules required:
tkinter: It is pre-installed module used to create the Graphical User Interface for desktop applications.

subprocess: It helps to create process and to retrieve inputs, outputs or errors in the code.
